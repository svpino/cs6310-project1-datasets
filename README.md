# CS6310 - Software Architecture and Design 

### Project 1 Sample Datasets

The following is a list of sample datasets that you can use to test your solution for Project 1. These files follow the same format than the student_demand files provided as part of the project.

Next to each file, you can see the expected result.

* demand1 - __X = 3__
* demand2 - __X = 4__
* demand3 - __X = 7__
* demand4 - __X = 10__
* demand5 - __X = 13__
* demand6 - __X = 3__
* demand7 - __X = 4__
* demand8 - __X = 7__
* demand9 - __X = 10__
* demand10 - __X = 13__
* demand11 - __X = 1__
* demand12 - __X = 2__

### Automated Test Running

To automatically test your program output, use the `test_runner.sh` shell script (_thanks to Shim Manning for the idea!_). It will automatically assume the path to your java class to be `/home/ubuntu/workspace/ProjectOne`, but this can be overridden as follows:

```
./test_runner.sh /home/ubuntu/alternative/path/to/bin
```
